Links to web browser privacy and hardening resources, as well as browser fingerprinting and identification developer tools. Private and state organizations monitor and record your online activities, so do google, bing, yanded, yahoo, baidu, facebook, and a million others. These are useful resources I've come across while making lots of, err, accounts.
  
This list will mostly focus on browsers/browser config.

## Alternative Browsers ##
- [SRWare Iron (Chrome)](http://www.srware.net/en/software_srware_iron.php) Chrome with the eye of sauron removed.
- [Pale Moon (Firefox)](https://www.palemoon.org/) Custom-built and optimizedMozilla Firefox browsers for Windows Operating Systems.


## Firefox Config / Profile software ##
Firefox is a bit of a dog, but it's certainly less invasive than modern chrome builds.
- [ConfigFox](http://configfox.sourceforge.net/) - A utility to manage Firefox advanced, hidden settings and tweaks, mostly concerning security and privacy.
- [Firefox Profilemaker](https://www.ffprofile.com/) [Github](https://github.com/allo-/firefox-profilemaker) - Makes FF profiles with secure/private defaults. 
- [Firefox Environment Backup Extension](http://softwarebychuck.com/febe/febe.html#latest)  - FEBE allows you to quickly and easily backup your Firefox extensions. Rebuilds your extensions individually into installable .xpi files. 


## Firefox Config / Tweaks ##
- [Firefox bullshit removal via about:config](https://gist.github.com/haasn/69e19fc2fe0e25f3cff5) - Lots of config tweaks with explanations
- [Firefox Hardening](https://github.com/pyllyukko/user.js/) - This user.js is a bit over the top to be useable day to day, but it's a good start.

## Firefox about:config tweaks ##

- [UserAgentInfo](https://github.com/quentin389/UserAgentInfo) - PHP class for parsing user agent strings (HTTP_USER_AGENT). Includes mobile checks, bots and banned bots checks, browser types/versions and more.
- [http://mobiledetect.net/](http://mobiledetect.net/) Mobile Detect is a lightweight PHP class for detecting mobile devices (including tablets). Stacks of plugins.
- [Browscap](http://tempdownloads.browserscap.com/) - browscap contains a huge database of incredibly detailed specific user agents information but it sucks with newer user agents and sucks even more for mobile detection.
